# Duplicacy Backups 

The scripts here will run automated backups using duplicacy on Windows (powershell) or Linux (bash).  The wiki also contains some documentation on how to set up duplicacy and some explanation of what the various commands do.  

See [the wiki](https://github.com/mattjm/duplicacy-script/wiki) for documentation on how to use the scripts.
